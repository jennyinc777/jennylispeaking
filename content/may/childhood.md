When I think about on my childhood, at first there isn’t much that comes to mind. What can you really say about a suburb 40 minutes north of Atlanta, GA. It was like any other WASP place in the United States circa 2007. There was a Kroger, a Walmart, a McDonalds, a Chick-fil-a, and a Costco all on the same street. That street would eventually turn into a smaller road which was where I grew up, in a cookie cutter, Pulte, 3-bed, 3-bath little house across the street from a middle school.

There are many things that I would like to say about my childhood but they feel like they have properties of a gas. I can’t seem to hold onto the memories — probably because most of those crucial core memories happened in my mind while on the outside, I painted a wholly different picture of who I was. Only when I was in my late 20’s did I look back on my past and began to see cracks in the idyllic suburban life that was my childhood.

I really started to dig deeper into my childhood when I was pregnant with my daughter.  The pregnancy book I was reading (called [The Motherly Guide to Becoming Mama](https://www.amazon.com/Motherly-Guide-Becoming-Mama-Redefining-ebook/dp/B07SMFY6N6), great book by the way) suggested that my husband and I think about our childhoods, what went well and what didn't, so that we could have an understanding of what our values are when we raise our daughter.  The more I thought about it, the more I realized how extremely lonely I was when I was a child.  The idea that I could depend on someone emotionally was laughable.  I remember in 8th grade, my teacher told the entire class that we were to get something signed off every week by our parents.  My mom told me that she didn't want to sign it off anymore and permitted me to forge her signature.  One day, I had forgotten to sign my sheet off at home and so I forged the signature in class.  A girl caught me signing my sheet and she told the teacher, who promptly sided with me, saying that I did no such thing.  That girl said threateningly that she was going to beat me up after class.  Looking back, I was so stressed.  I didn't know if I was going to come home with a black eye or how to even explain myself -- that my mom didn't want to sign this sheet or lie to protect her?  I didn't tell my parents.  Perhaps I felt like it would fall on deaf ears.  Perhaps I felt like it was no big deal.  Perhaps I felt like my mom had bigger things to worry about.  For whatever reason, these small (but stressful) moments in life fell squarely on my shoulders at a young age.  ~~After I got married, my husband showed me time and time again that burdens can be shared with him and that I could lean on him when the going gets tough.~~

Maybe this was because I grew up in a Chinese immigrant household.  No one had any [emotional intelligence](https://www.amazon.com/Adult-Children-Emotionally-Immature-Parents/dp/1626251703).  I don't remember how I came upon this book, but Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents by Lindsay Gibson, changed my life.  I felt as though for the first time someone finally understood how I was feeling in my childhood -- confused, lost, and lonely.

> Growing up in a family with emotionally immature parents is a lonely experience.  These parents may look and act perfectly normal, caring for their child's physical health and providing meals and safety.  However, if they don't make a solid emotional connection with their child, the child will have a gaping hole where true security might have been.
... Emotional loneliness is a vague and private experience, not easy to see or describe.  You might call it a feeling of emptiness or being alone in the world.

That was exactly it.  It is also why it's so difficult to talk about.  Because my parents gave me everything I physically needed, it is hard to figure out what's wrong.  Furthermore, I can't deny that I felt spoiled or asking for too much.  But that feeling of being lonely and it being a "vague and private experience" is undeniable.

Another quintessential aspect of the immigrant class is, of course, academics.  There was so much pressure to achieve and do things for that college transcript that I didn't know what I liked or disliked.  Things like playing tennis, volunteering for nonprofits, and playing violin were all a means to an end.  They were so intwined with my identity that I couldn't even answer the simple question of do I like them or not.  It wasn't even a question that I thought about.  The fear of quitting and not having anything to write on my transcript put me right back in my place.

My parents are immigrants to this country and I have heard numerous stories of their struggle to get here.  They are shaped by their harrowing experiences and I'm certain their relationship with risk is one that makes them gravitate towards security in the United States.  Their goal in this country is [survival](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html#:~:text=From%20the%20bottom%20of%20the,can%20attend%20to%20higher%20needs.) and they unknowingly put this same expectation on their children.  The child grows up not in a war-torn area and doesn't only have 3 dollars to their name.  They grow up in suburbia -- trying to navigate looking different than everyone else and Homecoming.  Instead, I felt like the pressure to succeed was life or death.  I felt like I couldn't rest until I obtained my goal.  I wish my parents taught me how to de-stress **alongside** work ethic, how to rest **coupled with** diligent progress towards goals, and how to listen to my feelings **together with** building resiliency.  I respect and admire my parents' tenacity and their struggle but the same logic and values may not work for their children's life, which looks vastly different from theirs.

Interlude:  I really hope I don't sound like a brat!  I am privileged to have been born in this country and my parents have met my physical needs above and beyond anything they could have ever imagined.  The opportunities and ways to succeed are boundless here.  But I just want to share my experience and provide nuance to living in this period as a 2nd generation child.  I want to be realistic with how I view my childhood -- to ensure that I give equal value to the good and the bad.

As I was searching for answers, I came upon Anne Helen Peterson's book called [Can't Even: How Millennials Became the Burnout Generation](https://www.amazon.com/Cant-Even-Millennials-Burnout-Generation/dp/0358315077).  This book painted a backdrop of how I grew up.  It explained:

> Millennials became the first generation to fully conceptualize themselves as walking college resumes.  With assistance from our parents, society, and educators, we came to understand ourselves, consciously or not, as “human capital”: subjects to be optimized for better performance in the economy.
That pressure to achieve wouldn’t have existed without the notion that college, no matter the cost, would provide a path to middle-class prosperity and stability.  But as millions of overeducated, underemployed, and student-debt-laden millennials will tell you, just because everyone around you believes in the gospel doesn’t mean it’s necessarily true.
College didn’t alleviate the economic anxiety of our parents.  It didn’t even guarantee our position in the middle class, or, in many cases, actually prepare us for the job market.  But the preparation for college taught us a valuable, lingering lesson:  how to orient our entire lives around the idea that hard work brings success and fulfillment, no matter how many times we’re confronted with proof to the contrary.

and:

> [Millennials] spent a ton of time with adults, and learned the external markings of performing adulthood, but lack the independence and strong sense of self that accompanies a less surveilled and protected childhood.

These passages hit home for me.  They give language and nuance to what I was already feeling for a long time, that this push for success and performance in our children leads ironically to what parents don't want -- burnout and failure.  This analysis from Peterson gives a history of how we got here from the Boomer generation all the way to Millennial adults.

Next, I came upon [Katherout's videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKFypHcnGu4) about how she no longer aspires to have a career.  I realize that there is a whole cohort of people just like me -- trying to figure out why they feel chronically tired, on edge, and disillusioned.
